If my script helped you in any way, please support me.<br>
<br>
Include my script in your InnoSetup script, one of ANSI or UTF8, depends of your script encoding.<br>
<br>
Or, just simple copy the content of my script and paste it in your script.<br>
<br>
Note for all InnoSetup installers creators.<br>
Please close all running program instances and it's subprocesses at the uninstallation, and don't leave them opened, because uninstallation may fail and the files may stay in the user storage.
